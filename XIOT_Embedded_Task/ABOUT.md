What i wanted to accomplish with my application :-
--> Write arduino function to control one input and output (IO Pins) 
    the input pin is a switch as interrupt once it pressed it should lighting the led connected to output pin.
--> If the switch pressed must send “pressed” to the serial monitor only one time also send the LED states ”ON” or “OFF”.
--> The whole function could be used many times in the program without interfering each-other.
--> My program can send continuous serial date comes from temperature sensor with 3 second rate at the same time.



What i learned in the process :-
--> Things that i have learned first time while making the program are the interrupt routine 
    and the special interrupt pins for every arduino board.
--> Also get the experience of using the virtual terminal @ Proteus.

Experience i have with the particular language and framework you chose :-
--> I choose to make the code using arduino functions, i have a good experience from my previous work with arduino.
    like using Switches, LEDs, Potentiometers, Motors, LCDs, Temperature sensor, Light sensor, Infrared sesnor, Ultrasonic sensor. etc.
